A repository to accompany select applied sessions during VADA summer school of June 2019.


## Techniques for Reproducible Visualisation in R: Graph as a Sequence of Three Functions.   
Date : _2019-06-12-Wednesday_  
Time : _13:00 - 15:00_  

The session demonstrates a technique for organizing workflows that generate reproducible data visualisations. Rarely do applied data science projects produce any given graph only once.The need to generate plots of the same form using different inputs, different options, and in multiple contexts requires the analyst to structure the operations involved in graph production as customizable functions. The technique demonstrated in this session divides the production of data visualizations into three sections, each governed by a dedicated function. The first function prepares the data for graphing, the second produces the graphic, and the third prints the image to disk. This applied session will walk the learner through the stages of developing such a chain of functions and demonstrate the advantages of such an approach in reproducible projects. Data and starter scripts will be provided. Software in focus: RStudio, R, specifically ggplot2 package. For updates and additional information see https://github.com/andkov/vada-2019-summer-school.

## Using github for data science:  version control, project management,promotion  
Date: _2019-06-13-Thursday_  
Time: _8:30 - 10:30_  

The sessions offers a hands-on walk through a minimalistic project designed to introduce the learner to basic operational utility of git and github in data science projects. While git(hub) is best known for providing version control and streamlining collaboration in software development, its applications in data analytic projects can enhance the robustness of the produced solutions and help make results more visible and accessible to the community. The topics to be covered include: 1) project kickoff from a standard stencil (https://github.com/wibeasley/RAnalysisSkeleton ),  2) using Github client for version control 3) using Github Issues for structuring tasks in project development 3) team control and communication and 4) designing an effective README page that faces the public. Data and starter scripts will be provided. Software in focus: R, RStudio, github client. For updates and additional information see https://github.com/andkov/vada-2019-summer-school.
